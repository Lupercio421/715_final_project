# 715 Final Project

For my STAT 715 - Time Series final project, I have decided to work with data from NYC first responding agencies. All of the data cleaning and time series methods and forecasts are found in the "911_response_times.Rmd" file. You can view a more polished Rmarkdown of this project in the "STAT_715_Presentation.Rmd" file.
