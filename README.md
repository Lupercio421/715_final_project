# 715 Final Project

For my final project, I have decided to work with data from NYC first responding agencies. All of the data cleaning and time series methods and forecasts are found in the [911_response_times.Rmd](https://github.com/Lupercio421/715_final_project/blob/master/911_response_times.Rmd) file. You can view a more polished Rmarkdown of this project in the [STAT_715_Presentation.Rmd](https://github.com/Lupercio421/715_final_project/blob/master/STAT_715_Presentation.Rmd) file. A detailed write up can be found on my [medium blog](https://rb.gy/2xr4bn).
